            Mrs. Stockmann. You see, if you come an hour late, Mr. Billing, you
            have to put up with cold meat.

            Billing (as he eats). It is uncommonly good, thank you—remarkably good.

            Mrs. Stockmann. My husband makes such a point of having his meals
            punctually, you know.

            Billing. That doesn't affect me a bit. Indeed, I almost think I enjoy a
            meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself, and
            undisturbed.

            Mrs. Stockmann. Oh well, as long as you are enjoying it—. (Turns to
            the hall door, listening.) I expect that is Mr. Hovstad coming too.

            Billing. Very likely.

            (PETER STOCKMANN comes in. He wears an overcoat and his official hat,
            and carries a stick.)

            Peter Stockmann. Good evening, Katherine.
