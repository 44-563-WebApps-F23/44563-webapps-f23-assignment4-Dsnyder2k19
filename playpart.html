        <h1>Dylan Snyder acts in a play</h1>
        <h3>Act 1, SS:43-49</h3>
        <h3><i>An Enemy of the People</i> by Henkrik Ibsen</h3>
            <h5>Mrs. Stockmann.</h5> 
            <p>You see, if you come an hour late, Mr. Billing, you
                have to put up with cold meat.</p>

           <h5>Billing (as he eats).</h5> 
           <p>It is uncommonly good, thank you—remarkably good.</p>

            <h5>Mrs. Stockmann.</h5> 
            <p>My husband makes such a point of having his meals
                punctually, you know.</p>

            <h5>Billing.</h5> 
            <p>That doesn't affect me a bit. Indeed, I almost think I enjoy a
                meal all the better when I can sit down and eat all by myself, and
                undisturbed.</p>

            <h5>Mrs. Stockmann.</h5> 
            <p>Oh well, as long as you are enjoying it—. (Turns to
                the hall door, listening.) I expect that is Mr. Hovstad coming too.</p>

            <h5>Billing.</h5> 
            <p>Very likely.</p>

            <p>(PETER STOCKMANN comes in. He wears an overcoat and his official hat,
                and carries a stick.)</p>

            <h5>Peter Stockmann.</h5>
            <p>Good evening, Katherine.</p>
